            My name is Angela Lam and I am an aspiring developer from Southern California.
            I am currently working as a Software Developer Intern at Ardent Labs and a Teaching Assitant for their afterschool classes at Ardent Academy.
            In the summers, I am also an IT Contractor for the scoring teams at tournaments run by USA Archery.

            I am an avid gamer, archer, and creative in my free time and I enjoy travelling and seeing the world.
            I graduated from UCLA (Go Bruins!) in Summer 2018 with a degree in Computational and Systems Biology and a minor in Mathematics.

            I started coding in college, and I came to love the challenges that came with it and the satisfaction of finding really nice solutions.
            During my time in college, aside from being an active member of the Archery Club, learned a lot of things, and even helped publish a <a>research paper</a>,
            but some of the most important lessons I learned have been incorporated into things that I consider a part of my working philosophy today.
