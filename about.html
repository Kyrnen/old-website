      Hi! I'm Angela.

    <div>
      I'm an aspiring game developer, archer, and creative from Southern California, currently working as a Software Developer Intern and Teaching Assistant at Ardent Labs and Ardent Academy.
      I graduated from UCLA in Summer 2018 with a degree in Computational and Systems Biology and a minor in Mathematics, where I was an active member and eventually even became president of the Archery Club.
      
      
      
      If you would like to talk, whether it's questions or feedback please feel free to contact me! I've provided a couple of different ways to find me.
      Thanks for visiting my webpage!
