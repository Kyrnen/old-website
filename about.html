      Hi! I'm Angela.
    </h1>
    
    <div>
      Thanks for visiting my website!
      My name is Angela Lam and I am an aspiring developer from Southern California. I am currently working as a Software Developer Intern at Ardent Labs and a Teaching Assitant for their afterschool classes at Ardent Academy.
      I am an avid gamer, archer, and creative in my free time and I enjoy travelling and seeing the world, which I am fortunate to do as a contractor for the scoring team with USA Archery. I started coding in college, but I love the challenges that come with it and that satisfaction of finding really nice solutions.
      I graduated from UCLA (Go Bruins!) in Summer 2018 with a degree in Computational and Systems Biology and a minor in Mathematics and had a lot of really amazing adventures travelling and competing with their Archery Club. During my time in college, I learned a lot of things, and even helped publish a <a>research article</a>, but some of the most important lessons I learned have been incorporated into things that I consider a part of my working philosophy.

    <h3>Why Video Games?</h3>
    
    <div>
      Everyone has their own unique experiences with a game, and in the same way, a game can make you feel a certain way through the experience that it provides.
      Growing up, I didn't have the oppurtunity to go out and buy every new game that came out, or even every new system, so I came to really cherish the experiences that were afforded to me. Rather than playing games as a "one and done" kind of deal, I would play games over and over again. As I replayed games, I would always find new things in the game, put in by the creators, and I really began to appreciate the effor that was put into each game.
      While I wouldn't say that I am looking exclusively to code in video games, it has been a dream that I hadn't acknowledged since I was very young, and after trying it out for myself, I have grown to love it.
      I like to put my best effort into anything that I do because I take a lot of pride in the work that I put out. I also love being able to make an impact where I can, which was something I found through volunteering at libraries and with clubs in high school and continued in college.
      Making games for me is putting all of my philosophies together, and the more I learn about game development, the more I can come to appreciate games that are made as well as enjoy what I accomplish.
      I had a late start, but for me, it is just a beginning! I am learning a lot from my experiences making games now, and I can't wait to share the results with the rest of the world!
