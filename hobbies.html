      Hi! Welcome to my Hobbies Page!
    </div>
    <div>
      This is the space on my website where I want to store all the things about my hobbies.
      When I originally was making my website, I just wanted to have a place to store all of my prior projects as essentially a portfolio.
      However, as I was creating the website, I couldn't help but think... why does it have to be just for my portfolio? Why couldn't I make it something that I could use as well?
      
      And so this will be a much more casual part of my website, that I can continue to improve on and add new features that I wouldn't usually use on a portfolio page. Maybe one day, there will be projects here that you can try for yourself!
      I look forward to seeing how this page grows and I hope you will as well!
